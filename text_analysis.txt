In this exercise, we created a Python program to perform text analysis and Named Entity Recognition using the spaCy library.
We loaded the English language model and processed a sample text. We tokenized the text and displayed basic statistics
such as the number of tokens, unique tokens, and word frequency.
Finally, we performed Named Entity Recognition on the text and displayed the extracted entities and their labels.
